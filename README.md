# Algorithms II - Data Structures 💻

Welcome to my **Algorithms II** repository! This project contains the source code and exercises I developed to understand core data structures and low-level memory management, primarily using **C**.

## 📚 Topics Covered

In this repository, I implemented and explored the following fundamental concepts:

* **Structs**: Creating custom and complex data types to group related variables.
* **Memory Management**: Manipulating and allocating dynamic memory using pointers.
* **Linked Lists**: Implementing dynamic, node-based linear data structures.
  
* **Stacks**: Exploring the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle.
  
* **Queues**: Exploring the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle.
  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
* **Language**: C/C++
* **Concepts**: Pointers, Dynamic Allocation, Data Structures
